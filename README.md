# ROpdebee's Personal Homebrew Tap
This tap contains some formulae which don't quite fit in `homebrew/core`, mainly because of a lack of notability, but that I use personally.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install ropdebee/personal/<formula>`

Or `brew tap ropdebee/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
